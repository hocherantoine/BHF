Scripts corresponding to R analysis carried for our study on histone-fold proteins in Bacteria. 
Scripts might change slightly before final publication (most likely a bit more annotation when needed). Because the search for proteins requires a local database that can't be easily uploaded some parts of the script will require re-building a local DB. As this might not be handy for everyone, which is why we provide the list and sequence of all hits obtained as supplementary data.
In any case I'm happy to answer questions.
